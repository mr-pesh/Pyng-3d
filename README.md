# Pyng Framework
Pyng is a set of tools that allows working with rendering pipeline in a platform independent way.

It provides the abstraction layer, which helps developers to write code that doesn’t depend on your system’s graphics API (DirectX, OpenGL etc.), making it ideal for building UI frameworks, 2D and 3D engines.

The main purpose of the framework is to ship flexible API, focusing on performance and using hardware acceleration of your target system.
